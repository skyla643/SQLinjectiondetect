## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository containing the vulnerability scanner code from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory where the vulnerability scanner code is located.

   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

3. **Set Up Python Environment**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **Run the Script**: Run the vulnerability scanner script by executing the following command and providing the start URL as an argument.

   ```

5. **Review Output**: The script will start scanning the provided URL and its linked pages. If vulnerabilities are found, they will be printed to the console along with the corresponding URLs.

6. **Customize as Needed**: You can customize the vulnerability checks or modify the code according to your requirements. Simply edit the `vulnerability_scanner.py` file using a text editor or IDE.

7. **Repeat Scans**: You can repeat the scanning process with different URLs by running the script again with a new start URL.

8. **Feedback and Contributions**: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
